# gameshow
Simple Flutter app with different and simple games. I started it just as a port of my command-line based Tic-Tac-Toe (https://github.com/agustin-recoba/tictactoe) but decided to go down with a multi-game approach.

Games fully implemented:

    - Tic-Tac-Toe
    - Maze solving
    - Ascci art
    
Work in progress:

    - Explore with AI (computer vision based "veo veo" or "I spy"). 0% done
    - Secret santa (not an actual game but whatever). 0% done
