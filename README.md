# gameshow
Simple Flutter app. I started it just as a port of my command-line based Tic-Tac-Toe (https://github.com/agustin-recoba/tictactoe) but decided to go down with a multi-game approach.

Games fully implemented are:
    - Tic-Tac-Toe
    - Maze solving
Work in progress games are:
    - Explore with AI (computer vision based "veo veo" or "I spy"). 0% done
    - Secret santa (not an actual game but whatever). 0% done
    - Ascci art (play around with images and standard Ascci characters). 5% done
